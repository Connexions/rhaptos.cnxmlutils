      <para id="gd-idm51168">The complex exponential signal can thus be written in terms of its real and imaginary parts using Euler's relation. Thus, sinusoidal signals can be expressed as either the real or the imaginary part of a complex exponential signal (the choice depends on whether cosine or sine phase is needed) or as the sum of two complex exponentials. These two decompositions are mathematically equivalent to each other.</para>

On the left and right is the classic "Lena" image, which is used ubiquitously as a test image. It contains straight and curved lines, complicated texture, and a face. In the middle is a perspective display of the Lena image as a signal: a function of two spatial variables. The colors merely help show what signal values are about the same size. In this image, signal values range between 0 and 255; why is that?<media id="gd-idp27168" alt=""><image mime-type="" src="lena.png"/></media>Lena<media id="gd-idp28368" alt=""><image mime-type="" src="lenamesh.png" height="145" width="180"/></media>Lena as a signal
